# Why we need to study algorithm

为什么我们需要算法

## 1. Recursion 递归或递推

Repeat and repeat
重复又重复

## 2. Store (Memoize) 存储

Store the return value of the same situation and we can use the same value instead of computing again.

我们可以存储结果，当我们遇到同样的条件时就不用重新计算。

## 3. Bottom-up

Bottom-up（自下而上） programming is the opposite of top-down（自上而下） programming. It refers to a style of programming where an application is constructed starting with existing primitives of the programming language, and constructing gradually more and more complicated features, until the all of the application has been written.

与自下而上编程相对的是自上而下编程。
